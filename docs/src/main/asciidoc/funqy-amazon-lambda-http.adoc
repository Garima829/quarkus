= Quarkus - Funqy HTTP with Amazon LambdaÂ 
:extension-status: preview

include::./attributes.adoc[]

If you like link:funqy-http[Funqy HTTP], you can use it on AWS Lambda.  Quarkus allows you to expose multiple
Funqy functions through HTTP deployed as one AWS Lambda.

include::./status-include.adoc[]

Follow the link:amazon-lambda-http[Amazon Lambda Http Guide].  It walks through using a variety of HTTP
frameworks on Amazon Lambda, including Funqy.

== An additional Quickstart

Beyond generating an AWS project that is covered in the link:amazon-lambda-http[Amazon Lambda Http Guide],
there's also a quickstart for running Funqy HTTP on AWS Lambda.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `funqy-amazon-lambda-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/funqy-quickstarts/funqy-amazon-lambda-http-quickstart[directory].

== The Code

There is nothing special about the code and more importantly nothing AWS specific.  Funqy functions can be deployed to many different
environments and AWS Lambda is one of them.  The Java code is actually the same exact code as the {quickstarts-tree-url}/funqy-quickstarts/funqy-http-quickstart[funqy-http-quickstart].

== Getting Started

The steps to get this quickstart running are exactly the same as defined in the link:amazon-lambda-http[Amazon Lambda HTTP Guide].
This differences are that you are running from a quickstart and the maven dependencies are slightly different.
